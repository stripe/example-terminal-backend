# Example Terminal Backend

This is a simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) webapp that you can use to run the [Stripe Terminal](https://stripe.com/docs/terminal) example apps. To get started, you can choose from the following options:

1. [Run it on a free Render account](#running-on-render)
2. [Run it on Heroku](#running-on-heroku)
3. [Run it locally on your machine](#running-locally-on-your-machine)
4. [Run it locally via Docker CLI](#running-locally-with-docker)

ℹ️  You also need to obtain your Stripe **secret, test mode** API Key, available in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys). Note that you must use your secret key, not your publishable key, to set up the backend. For more information on the differences between **secret** and publishable keys, see [API Keys](https://stripe.com/docs/keys). For more information on **test mode**, see [Test and live modes](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#test-live-modes).

### Running locally on your machine

If you prefer running the backend locally, ensure you have the required [Ruby runtime](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) version installed as per the [latest Gemfile in this repo](Gemfile).

You'll also need the correct [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) version, outlined in the [Gemfile.lock](Gemfile.lock) under the `BUNDLED_WITH` directive.

Clone down this repo to your computer, and then follow the steps below:

1. Create a file named `.env` within the newly cloned repo directory and add the following line:
```
STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}
```
2. In your terminal, run `bundle install`
3. Run `ruby web.rb`
4. The example backend should now be running at `http://localhost:4567`
5. Go to the [next steps](#next-steps) in this README for how to use this app

### Running locally with Docker

We have a pre-built Docker image you can run locally if you're into the convenience of containers.

 Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) if you don't already have it. Then follow the steps below:

1. In your terminal, run `docker run -e STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY} -p 4567:4567 stripe/example-terminal-backend` (replace `{YOUR_API_KEY}` with your own test key)
2. The example backend should now be running at `http://localhost:4567`
3. Go to the [next steps](#next-steps) in this README for how to use this app
